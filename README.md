# Temperature Conversion Program

This repository contains the code for the temperature conversion program developed as part of the Software Development Internship.

## Description

The program converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. It prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement, then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the results.

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `temperature_conversion.py`.
4. Run the script using the command:
    ```sh
    python temperature_conversion.py
    ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a temperature value and the unit of measurement.

## Example

```sh
Enter the temperature value: 25
Enter the unit of measurement (C, F, K): C
25°C is equivalent to 77.00°F and 298.15K
